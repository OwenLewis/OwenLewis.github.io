                                    This is a short essay about my tenure track job search. In general, I would describe my experience as "rough." Not as rough as some, but definitely not pleasant. After securing a tenure track position that I am extremely excited about, I decided to go back and crunch the numbers just to see how much work I'd done.
                                </p>

                                    Other than pure, morbid curiosity, I wanted to go through this exercise in order to help process my own feelings about my job search. I also wanted to reflect on what I would and would not have changed about my professional trajectory over the past 6 years. If anyone else reading this finds this information helpful, please drop me a line and let me know.

                                    Over the course of 3 years, I kept a pretty meticulous spreadsheet of every job I applied for. It included (among other information) the posting url, the deadline, notes about the department I was applying to and the existing faculty in that department, the specific subfield requested in the job posting, the teaching load, the number of letters of recommendation required, etc. It was all color coded and frankly quite daunting. While very useful during the job search process (and I do recommend anyone else on the job market keep similar records), most of that information is irrelevant to this post. For today, I just needed to know how many jobs I had applied to and how far in the interview process I had made it for each. That was a relatively quick bit of data processing.

                                    The above figure summarizes the data from my first year on the job market. As you can clearly see, it did not go well for me. I have multiple thoughts on why this occurred:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>I did not have a particularly productive first post-doc. My CV at this point in my career was "fine", but certainly not exemplary.</li>
                                        <li>I had no clear sense of direction with respect to what type of institution I wanted to be a part of. This, combined with the fact that my post-doc contract was ending (and so was my funding), lead to a very "scatter-shot" attitude towards job applications. I applied to basically any job that was posted, as long as the desired specialization was remotely related my own. Many of the jobs that I applied to I was completely inappropriate for. As an aside, this lead to a drastic increase in the amount of work required to submit these applications. I had to write multiple different research/teaching/diversity statements which were each tailored to a specific type of institution. I also wrote each and every department a customized cover letter, reflecting which of my qualifications I wanted to highlight for that particular institution and department. It was a colossal amount of work. </li>
                                        <li>2017 was an extremely competitive year in my field. I had multiple peers (and good friends) in my specialization who were all on the market at the same time. Some of them had objectively better CV's than I did (see item 1). Some of them had already made the decision about what particular type of institution they wanted to end up at (see item 2), and had been working for multiple years to make themselves (and their job packet) attractive to that type of school. </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    All in all, I think it is best to view my 2017 as the situation you do <i>not</i> want to find yourself in.

                                        My 2018 tenure track search. I did a little better this year, and managed to secure an invitation to an on-campus interview. However all applications still ended in rejection or no response.

                                    The 2017-2018 academic year (or the period between the 2017 and 2018 job searches) was a big one for me: I published multiple first-author papers, I received funding for an R01 grant that I had written and submitted the previous year, and I moved all the way across the country to begin my second post-doc. After landing at my new institution I immediately went back on the market. This time, I was safe in the knowledge that I had multiple years of funding secured and decided to be somewhat picky about which jobs I applied for. I revised my research statement to reflect the growth in my research program, polished my teaching teaching statement, and updated the rest of my application packet. I felt very confident as I began applying for jobs in the Fall of 2018. Purely by chance, there was a large number of jobs in my specialization posted, so my total number of applications was significantly higher than I intended.
                                </p>
                                <p class="excert">
                                    Things certainly went better than the previous year (but I would I still end the year with a disappointing taste in my mouth). Despite a 45% decrease in the number of applications submitted, I secured roughly the same number of preliminary interviews. I was also invited to give my job talk at one on-campus interview. I was elated; not only because I finally got to use my "interview suit", but also because the university that extended the invitation could be classified as a "reach" school for me. Just being asked to come interview in person was an extremely validating experience. Unfortunately, they went with another candidate, and my hopes withered on the vine a second time.

                                    Trying to extract a "teachable" lesson from the 2018 job search was extremely difficult. I felt like I had done everything right. All the feedback I was receiving from established people in my field was complimentary. And yet, nothing. In the end, after much reflection, I kept coming back to the very first piece of advise I was given by a senior colleague as I approached the job market:
                                </p>
                                <div class="quote-wrapper">

                                        The academic job search is the most stochastic process I have ever witnessed. I've been on five search committees now, and not once have I totally understood why we chose the candidate that we did.
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                At the end of the day, randomness is just an inherent part of the process. Search committees are forced to scan HUNDREDS of job applications for every position that is posted. The noise-to-signal ratio is absolutely enormous. "Competitive" (and even "strong") candidates get filtered out. Politics within a department may cause the committee to change or narrow their field of focus (while this may not be random, to an outside observer it certainly appears so). As a candidate, there are a million factors you cannot control (or even be aware of) that can scuttle your candidacy. You just have to accept that luck might not be on your side.

                                    In September of 2019, I entered the market for the third and final time. My attitude toward applications actually evolved over the course of the semester. At first, I employed a strategy similar to 2017. I applied to <i>everything</i>. Submitting job applications became a half-time job for me. Fortunately, this attitude didn't last long. By November, I had come around to the idea that I might not find a position I was happy with, and was surprisingly okay with the thought. I began to view job postings with a more discriminating eye before applying to anything, I asked myself "If this job was the only one offered to me, would I rather do something else outside of academia?" If the answer to that question was yes, I simply moved on with my life. Consequently, the total number of jobs I applied to ended somewhere in between 2018 and 2017.

                                    For reasons that are beyond my comprehension, my final job search was successful. Shockingly so. Of the departments that I applied to, roughly a fifth asked me for a preliminary interview. Of those, roughly a third asked me for on-campus interviews. Over half of my on-campus interviews resulted in job offers. What had changed since 2018? Frankly, not much. I made minor revisions to the various statements in my job packet. I added a single item to my list of publications, taught one more class, participated in a new STEM outreach program, and started mentoring two undergraduate research projects. These all constituted marginal improvements to the totality of my CV; roughly four new lines on a four page document. In my opinion, I was not an appreciably "stronger" candidate in 2019 than I was in 2018. And yet here I am, reflecting on three years in academic limbo, excited to move back across the country and begin a tenure track position that I am <i>thrilled</i> to have secured. So what is the lesson of 2019? I'm honestly not sure. Be persistent? Maybe I should just be thankful that all that work finally paid off. I'm not sure.

                                    And here, finally, we have the combined data of my three years on the job market. Quite frankly, this whole essay came about because I wanted to generate this figure right here. Just look at it! Nearly 130 labor intensive applications that just disappeared into the ether and never even elicited a response. Even now it fills me with a deep sense of impuissance. As an act of catharsis, I've I have tried to identify a set of lessons that I learned through the whole process. If anyone embarking on the academic job market finds these helpful, then writing all this out was worth it. Please bear in mind that I have not quite begun my career as a first-year professor, so please take this for what it is: the opinion of one man, who by his own admission isn't very good at getting a job.

                                            This one could not be more obvious. It is mostly only on this list just to provide some context in which to discuss the next few items, but I will elaborate a tiny bit. You need "deliverables" on your CV, because at some point someone is simply going to count them (more on what those deliverables may be in a bit). Quantity doesn't trump quality, but sometimes you need to meet a minimum threshold to get the rest of your packet looked at seriously. Also, simple counting metrics could occasionally be used by committees to "break a tie" when deciding which candidate to progress in the process. Try to mitigate the risk of getting the short straw. Work hard during your post-doc, but try to make sure that work translates into finished product.

                                            This one is hard, and I honestly feel like somewhat of a hypocrite putting in on this list, but I really think it is important. Do you want to end up at an R1 institution? Would you be happier at a teaching oriented university? What kind of teaching oriented university? Maybe a small liberal arts college is the right fit for you. Perhaps you would be happier at a public school that serves a large population of non-traditional, first-generation, or under-represented students. It can be really difficult to know, but the sooner you figure this out the better off you will be, because it means that you can spend your years as a post-doc making yourself into an attractive candidate for that type of school. And this brings us back to the aforementioned "deliverables": concrete items on your CV. When applying to an R1 school, research is king (this is obvious and everyone knows it). You need to produce multiple strong publications, and some grant funding wouldn't hurt. Institutions that are less research-oriented still demand candidates with expansive CVs, they are just looking for different types of accomplishments (and "I taught the classes that I was assigned and my students liked me" does not count as an accomplishment). Did you attend a workshop on cutting edge pedagogy? Did that workshop lead to some form of publication about a new instructional technique? Did you help run some form of outreach program introducing a wider community to your research field? Were you the director? There is a good chance that the search committee is reading the CVs of at least one candidate who was.

                                            <br>
                                            Look, none of this is groundbreaking or mysterious. But the point I am trying to make is that it is really difficult to become a strong candidate in every facet. I don't suggest even trying. That was my mistake. I like my research, and I like teaching. Even by the beginning of my job search I couldn't honestly say what type of institution I felt was the right fit for me. I only really figured it through a bunch of interviews and the process of elimination. Unfortunately, by the I had spent several years trying to be a "jack of all trades" and ending up as a master of none. That just didn't cut it.

                                            <h5>Begin applying to jobs the year before you "have to."</h5>
                                            I myself debated doing this, and ultimately decided not to. I'm honestly not sure that hitting the market in 2016 would have been the right plan for me. However, if you and/or your adviser think your CV is competitive, I would recommend you go for it and I have a few reasons. Preparing your job packet is a lot of work. Writing your research and teaching statements will not be fun. Rip that band-aid off early. If you write them a year early, it also makes it <i>impossible</i> to procrastinate and do a half-assed job. It also means that if your first search fails, instead of the arduous task of writing a research statement the following year, you have the much less painful task of polishing a research statement. Finally, the job market can be a bizarre and random place. Sometimes luck just isn't on your side. If you go on the market a year before you need to and get unlucky, you have another try. Two bites at the apple, as it were.

                                            <br>
                                            There is one very good counter-argument to this point, and I would be remiss if I did not bring it up here. Applying before you have to does eat up bandwidth in what could potentially be a very important summer to get work done and round out your CV. You should only do this if you think you are a competitive candidate. Otherwise that time would be better spent <i>making</i> yourself a competitive candidate.

                                            <h5>Don't apply to any jobs you wouldn't take.</h5>
                                            Again, this seems obvious, but it can be very hard to keep in mind when you're actively searching for a job. Are you completely miserable in the cold? Maybe Minnesota isn't the right school for you. Absolutely loathe living in large cities? It probably isn't worth your time to even apply at Columbia. To be clear: I don't mean to imply that location should be the only criteria you consider here. Departmental fit and institutional fit (see above) should definitely be major parts of your decision making process. I just know (from experience) that it is very tempting to submit too many applications when you're in midst of the hunt. You will often feel desperate for <i>any</i> job. Fight this temptation. Take a deep breath and be honest with yourself: If you don't think you'd be happy working at that institution for 5 or 10 years, don't submit the application. You'll save yourself a lot of pain and effort. I wish I had.

                                            <h5>You will never hear back from roughly 45 institutions.</h5>
                                            I have no idea why that number is so consistent from year to year. Apparently there are about 45 universities in this country that can't even be bothered to say "Thanks, but no thanks." Don't let it get you down. Just move forward. You'll get to where you need to go.
